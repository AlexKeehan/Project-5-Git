PROJECT TITLE: My Calculator
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Calculate
VERSION or DATE: 4/24/2022
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run main()
AUTHORS: Me
USER INSTRUCTIONS: To start the program just run main and 
follow the directions provided.

Project Description:
The program contains two main parts. I have the Calculations
class that uses methods and the built in Java library Math to
solve the equations. The second part of the program is main
where I filter through what equation the user wants to use to
then call the appropriate method in Calculations. I also
have a history feature that took a lot of fiddling with to work.
To access the history, just type history and you should see all
the previous equations. There is a lot of information within
the program, so once you run main it should be clear what to do.

Input & Output:
This program only takes user input by using Scanner. The only
output is printing to the terminal, so nothing too crazy here.
